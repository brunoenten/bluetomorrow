As a result, the product is claimed to offer benefits in terms of nutritional profile and sustainability.</p>\n<p>For the commercialization of its fungi-based product, the NTU team reached out to the FOODBOWL, a national network of open-access food processing facilities supported by the New Zealand government. FOODBOWL and NTU are currently working together to upscale the innovative fungi-cultivation method, aiming for national commercialization in 2024.</p>\n<p>Professor William Chen, Director of NTU’s Food Science and Technology (FST) programme, who led the development of the food product, said: “Our fungi-based food product is yet another triumph for NTU, as we look to find successful ways to find new uses for products that would otherwise be left to waste. Upcycling these products to cultivate fungi, a food source familiar to Asian consumers, is an opportunity for enhancing processing efficiency in the food supply chain, as well as potentially promoting a healthier non-animal protein alternative to enrich diets.”</p>\n"

As the financial situation becomes more difficult, price parity will become increasingly important for the plant-based industry.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_55656\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-55656\" style=\"width: 1014px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-55656 size-large\" src=\"https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Pulled-BVQ-sandwich_1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Barvecue Plant-Based Pulled Pork\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Pulled-BVQ-sandwich_1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Pulled-BVQ-sandwich_1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Pulled-BVQ-sandwich_1-150x113.jpg 150w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Pulled-BVQ-sandwich_1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Pulled-BVQ-sandwich_1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Pulled-BVQ-sandwich_1-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Pulled-BVQ-sandwich_1-400x300.jpg 400w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Pulled-BVQ-sandwich_1-741x555.jpg 741w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Pulled-BVQ-sandwich_1-1320x990.jpg 1320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-55656\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">©Barvecue</figcaption></figure>\n<h2><strong>Plant-based sales</strong></h2>\n<p>While the recent figures may be concerning for some, the overall plant-based trend over the past two years has been very positive.

This year&#8217;s online polls and one-on-one telephone surveys have been conducted from July 4 to 17.</p>\n<p>In this survey, the primary age group that selected Dear, Klairs was the 20s and 30s, composed of 75.33% female and 23.67% male. One of the eye-catching features is that the brand received higher scores from the one-on-one telephone surveys. The telephone survey, which targeted 1,000 Generation MZ users who have vegan cosmetic experience, shows better accuracy than online polls.</p>\n<p>“We are more than grateful to receive the Brand of the Year Award that is recognized by its fairness and reliability through the nationwide consumer polls,” Wishcompany CEO Park Soungho said. “We will strive to grow into Korea’s leading vegan cosmetic brand based on Dear, Klairs’ philosophy of pursuing a balanced life.”</p>\n<p>Dear, Klairs has established itself as a steady seller in major distribution channels in 64 countries excluding China, such as the US, Europe, and Southeast Asia. It is also implementing campaigns focusing on Generation MZs who pursue vegan-friendliness and sustainability.</p>\n<p>Dear, Klairs is a brand launched in 2010. All Dear, Klairs products contain vegan formula, and have completed vegan certification by PETA, an international animal rights organization. In addition, top-selling products like the Supple Preparation Facial Toner and Freshly Juiced Vitamin Drop have surpassed 2 million bottle sales, becoming global million sellers at home and abroad.</p>\n<p><b>Contacts</b></p>\n<p>WISHCOMPANY</p>\n<p>PR Team</p>\n<p>Berry Jeon</p>\n<p>Rosa Kim</p>\n<p>+82 70-4366-5365</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:comm_lab@wishcompany.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">comm_lab@wishcompany.net</a></p>\n</div>\n"

Tuna giant Thai Union has launched plant-based shrimp dumplings and fish nuggets, and has also <a href=\"https://vegconomist.com/company-news/thai-union-ish-food/\">partnered with a US alt-seafood company</a> to help make sustainable alternatives available to consumers at affordable prices.</p>\n<p>Last year, Singapore&#8217;s Growthwell Foods <a href=\"https://vegconomist.com/investments-finance/growthwell-foods-raises-22-million-looks-to-accelerate-asian-alt-seafood-and-chicken-segments/\">raised $22 million</a> for its plant-based seafood, while Hong Kong&#8217;s OmniFoods has now launched its seafood alternatives <a href=\"https://vegconomist.com/food-and-beverage/meat-and-fish-alternatives/plant-based-omniseafood-arrives-in-the-uk/\">as far afield as the UK</a>.

Its commitment to helping the community, making healthy eating accessible, and tackling the climate crisis resonated with us all at Fuller’s,&#8221; said Paul Dickinson, Fuller’s Director of Food.</p>\n<p>He added, &#8220;We are also always looking at how we can diversify our menus. We know that plant-based dishes aren’t only for those following a vegan lifestyle – with nearly 40% of meat eaters in the UK having reduced their meat consumption in the last six months. So to be able to offer plant-based dishes that are nutritious and delicious is fantastic.”</p>\n<p>The Made in Hackney burger will be available at 18 selected Fuller&#8217;s locations in London and the surrounding area.</p>\n"

ProVeg International have recently published <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3KneLIQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an article</a> exploring this very question, outlining the pros and cons of organic certification for plant-based products and highlighting examples of different brands’ approaches.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a quick look at some of the top reasons why your company might want to consider making your plant-based products organic.</p>\n<h2><strong>Reasons to make your plant-based product organic</strong></h2>\n<p><b>1. Health benefits</b></p>\n<p>Organic connoisseurs aren’t the only health-seekers on the food scene. Health is a top motivation for flexitarians when choosing plant-based alternatives.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_80993\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80993\" style=\"width: 1014px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-80993 size-large\" src=\"https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/lesly-juarez-1rafrfyrsZw-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/lesly-juarez-1rafrfyrsZw-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/lesly-juarez-1rafrfyrsZw-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/lesly-juarez-1rafrfyrsZw-unsplash-150x100.jpg 150w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/lesly-juarez-1rafrfyrsZw-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/lesly-juarez-1rafrfyrsZw-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/lesly-juarez-1rafrfyrsZw-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/lesly-juarez-1rafrfyrsZw-unsplash-1320x880.jpg 1320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-80993\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Health is the number one motivator for people buying organic products. It’s also a key flexitarian motivator. Is this a match made in heaven? Image source: Unsplash / Lesly Juarez</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Based on ProVeg’s calculations (included in <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3KneLIQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the full article</a>), organic certification is around four times more prevalent in vegan alternatives than in conventional food products. So if your plant-based alternative is targeting health-conscious foodies, then organic ingredients may be the way to go.</p>\n<p><b>2. Taste</b></p>\n<p>All consumers are motivated by taste, but this is especially true for many organic consumers. Taste and freshness are key motivators for people buying organic products.</p>\n<p>While several studies have found no scientific evidence to support the claim of superior organic taste, a third of consumers nonetheless believe that organic foods taste better than conventional products.</p>\n<p><b>3. Demographics</b></p>\n<p>In the US, Millennials are now the largest generation and consumer segment. A 2019 study found that organic produce is a leading priority for almost 40% of these consumers – placing it narrowly above plant-based produce.</p>\n<p>The closeness of the two priorities suggests a potential overlap in interests among this demographic, who are seeking both plant-based and organic products in one.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_80992\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80992\" style=\"width: 490px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-80992 size-full\" src=\"https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/NFH-Plant-based-vs-organic-article-graphics.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/NFH-Plant-based-vs-organic-article-graphics.png 500w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/NFH-Plant-based-vs-organic-article-graphics-300x300.png 300w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/NFH-Plant-based-vs-organic-article-graphics-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-80992\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Although this study didn’t establish a causal relationship, it appears likely there is an overlap among Millennial consumers in the US who share a desire for organic and plant-based products.

In fact, sales of meat and dairy-free alternatives have doubled, making plant-based one of the fastest growing categories in retail.</p>\n<p>Whilst this trend isn’t new, the pandemic undoubtedly accelerated the move towards plant-based eating. COVID-19 prompted people to re-evaluate their priorities, with many taking steps to improve their health and live more sustainably. Reducing the intake of animal products offered a simple way to achieve both, with many households introducing meat-free days or cutting out certain meat and dairy products altogether.</p>\n<p>Now that we’re emerging from the pandemic, the demand for plant-based foods is beginning to shift from retailers to the out-of-home market, where consumers are increasingly looking for delicious, nutritious, and varied plant-based meal options. As a result, the plant-based market is continuing to thrive, with new and innovative products launching every single day.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Product Innovations </strong></p>\n<p>For those looking to discover the latest plant-based products all under one roof, Plant Based World Expo Europe returns to London Olympia on 30<sup>th</sup> November–1<sup>st</sup> December. The show will play host to over 150 exhibitors, from household names through to cutting-edge start-ups, which will display their latest innovations and tried and tested favourites.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_80840\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80840\" style=\"width: 909px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-80840 size-full\" src=\"https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Honestly-Tasty-Shamembert.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"919\" height=\"907\" srcset=\"https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Honestly-Tasty-Shamembert.jpg 919w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Honestly-Tasty-Shamembert-300x296.jpg 300w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Honestly-Tasty-Shamembert-150x148.jpg 150w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Honestly-Tasty-Shamembert-768x758.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 919px) 100vw, 919px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-80840\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Honestly Tasty &#8211; Shamembert © PBWE</figcaption></figure>\n<p>For those looking for meat alternatives that don’t compromise on flavour, The Raging Pig Company will join the line-up with its pig-less bacon, Raging Bacon. The company is on a mission to remove pigs from our food system and, after years of development, it has finally cracked the code for pig-less bacon that looks, cooks, and tastes like bacon from the past. Currently only available in Germany and Sweden, Raging Bacon will launch to the rest of the European market at the show.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_80843\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80843\" style=\"width: 2490px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-80843 size-full\" src=\"https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Raging-Pig-Bacon-.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1741\" srcset=\"https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Raging-Pig-Bacon-.jpg 2500w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Raging-Pig-Bacon--300x209.jpg 300w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Raging-Pig-Bacon--1024x713.jpg 1024w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Raging-Pig-Bacon--150x104.jpg 150w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Raging-Pig-Bacon--768x535.jpg 768w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Raging-Pig-Bacon--1536x1070.jpg 1536w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Raging-Pig-Bacon--2048x1426.jpg 2048w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Raging-Pig-Bacon--1320x919.jpg 1320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-80843\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Raging Pig Bacon © PBWE</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Also showcasing the latest in meat alternatives, Miami Foods will present its healthy take on plant-based products. The professional health-hackers take old favourites and redesign them to drastically reduce saturated fats and calories, without compromising on taste. Miami Foods will use the show to present its smoked streaky bacon rashers, classic burgers, and Louisiana Chick’n, as well as unveil some brand-new products for the very first time.</p>\n<p>Plus, Barcelona based &#8216;meat successor&#8217; brand Heura Foods will be revealing its new meat-free, centre-plate products, including its new gluten-free chick’n fillet burger, which is ideal for those with multiple dietary requirements.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_80839\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80839\" style=\"width: 9021px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-80839 size-full\" src=\"https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Heura-Foods-Chickn-Fillet-Burger.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"9031\" height=\"6020\" srcset=\"https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Heura-Foods-Chickn-Fillet-Burger.jpg 9031w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Heura-Foods-Chickn-Fillet-Burger-300x200.jpg 300w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Heura-Foods-Chickn-Fillet-Burger-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Heura-Foods-Chickn-Fillet-Burger-150x100.jpg 150w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Heura-Foods-Chickn-Fillet-Burger-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 9031px) 100vw, 9031px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-80839\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Heura Foods Chick&#8217;n Fillet Burger © PBWE</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The show will also welcome the latest in dairy-free innovation. For example, Hlthpunk will showcase its line of sustainable, organic, vegan mayos, featuring super clean ingredients. The product line-up includes Hlthpunk’s vegan oat-based mayo, Bionnaise Plant-Based Mayo, which has been dubbed ‘the best tasting mayo on the planet’.</p>\n<p>Honestly Tasty will present its game-changing, plant-based alternatives to cheese, including its camembert alternative, the Shamembert. A finalist for the 2022 Plant-Based Taste Awards at Plant Based World Expo New York, the Shamembert is cultured so that it develops an authentic white rind aesthetic as well as a real depth of flavour.</p>\n<p>Also showcasing cutting-edge cheese alternatives, Purezza, the UK’s first vegan pizzeria, will make its trade event debut at the show. The company will showcase its vegan mozzarella, which features on its award-winning pizzas and is now available for retail and food service professionals looking to create plant-based alternatives fit for pizza aficionados.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_80842\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80842\" style=\"width: 2550px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-80842 size-full\" src=\"https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Purezza-Vegan-Mozzarella-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" srcset=\"https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Purezza-Vegan-Mozzarella-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Purezza-Vegan-Mozzarella-300x200.jpg 300w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Purezza-Vegan-Mozzarella-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Purezza-Vegan-Mozzarella-150x100.jpg 150w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Purezza-Vegan-Mozzarella-768x512.jpg 768w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Purezza-Vegan-Mozzarella-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Purezza-Vegan-Mozzarella-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Purezza-Vegan-Mozzarella-1320x880.jpg 1320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-80842\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Purezza &#8211; Vegan Mozzarella © PBWE</figcaption></figure>\n<h2><strong>Current Trends</strong></h2>\n<p>The quality and breadth of plant-based meat and dairy alternatives on display at the show is a fantastic representation of the incredible innovation taking place in this area of the industry right now. This is reflective of consumer demand, with plant-based eaters and those who are reducing their meat intake expecting choice and variety when it comes to plant-based options.</p>\n<p>Manufacturers are also placing a firmer focus than ever on the taste of products. Just like the plant-based innovators on display at the show, we are seeing a trend across the board for plant-based foods that truly replicate the experience of meat-eaters so that those opting to avoid animal products don’t feel as though they’re missing out. For example, those making a burger at home, or ordering one in a restaurant now expect to have a choice of patty and for it to include cheese and a range of sauces. As a result, the mayo and wider sauce category is one of the biggest growth areas in the market right now, with dozens of cutting-edge, delicious plant-based options bursting onto the scene.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_80846\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80846\" style=\"width: 2240px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-80846 size-full\" src=\"https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2JF0117-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1500\" srcset=\"https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2JF0117-1.png 2250w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2JF0117-1-300x200.png 300w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2JF0117-1-1024x683.png 1024w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2JF0117-1-150x100.png 150w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2JF0117-1-768x512.png 768w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2JF0117-1-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2JF0117-1-2048x1365.png 2048w, https://vegconomist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2JF0117-1-1320x880.png 1320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2250px) 100vw, 2250px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-80846\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Miami Burger © PBWE</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Creating plant-based restaurant experiences to cater for all foodies, including plant-based eaters and flexitarians, without compromising on flavour or choice is another growing trend in the market. Purezza is a perfect example of the incredible plant-based eateries that are providing great-tasting foods that happen to be vegan. Plus, with brands like Heura creating plant-based foods that also cater for other allergens, such as gluten, we are seeing a shift towards a more inclusive approach to food. Brands are increasingly creating great-tasting products that are suitable for everyone to enjoy without compromise, both in and out of the home.</p>\n<h2><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></h2>\n<p>Clearly, it’s an incredibly exciting time for the plant-based industry. Caterers are no longer championing the bland, mushy, veggie burgers that we might have once expected to see on menus. Instead, they are working with manufacturers who are pushing boundaries to create taste-first, innovative meat and dairy alternatives that meat-eaters and non-meat eaters alike will enjoy eating. Moving forward, I expect to see other categories, such as the snack and fine-dining markets, following suit as brands find new ways to delight customers.</p>\n<p>For further information, or to register, visit <a href=\"http://www.plantbasedworldeurope.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://www.plantbasedworldeurope.com/</a></p>\n"
